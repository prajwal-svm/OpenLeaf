# E2E coverage matrix

Every interactive surface, mapped to the spec that exercises it. Status:
**✓** covered · **🔑** opt-in (env-gated: credentials/network) · **✋ manual**
(native OS dialogs, OS drag-drop, nondeterministic AI output - not
automatable by design) · **—** not yet covered (listed at the bottom).

## Known manual-only checks
OS drag-and-drop into the window; native save/open dialogs (exports); native
color pickers; fullscreen; the detached preview window; auto-updater; AI
conversations end-to-end. These are exercised by release smoke-testing.
