# Contributing to OpenLeaf

Thanks for wanting to make OpenLeaf better! This guide gets you from a fresh
clone to a working dev build, and covers how we review and land changes.

## Ways to contribute

- Report a bug: open a [bug report](https://github.com/prajwal-svm/OpenLeaf/issues/new/choose).
- Request a feature: open a [feature request](https://github.com/prajwal-svm/OpenLeaf/issues/new/choose).
- Report a vulnerability: please do not open a public issue; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Send a pull request: see below.

For anything larger than a small fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the
approach before you invest time.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) | 20+ | |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) | 9+ | `npm i -g pnpm` |
| [Rust](https://rustup.rs) | stable (1.77+) | includes `cargo` |
| Platform deps | - | See the [Tauri v2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your OS (on Linux: `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`, `patchelf`, …) |

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prajwal-svm/OpenLeaf.git
cd OpenLeaf
pnpm install

# Fetch the Tectonic (LaTeX compiler) sidecar for your machine's target.
# Find your target with `rustc -vV | grep host`.
bash scripts/fetch-tectonic.sh aarch64-apple-darwin   # or your host triple

# Run the app in dev mode (hot-reloads the frontend, rebuilds Rust on change):
pnpm tauri dev
```

> The Tectonic binaries are large (~50 MB each) and are **git-ignored** on
> purpose - never commit them. The fetch script drops them in
> `src-tauri/binaries/`, which is where `bundle.externalBin` expects them.

### Building a production bundle locally

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

Installers land in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Project layout

```
src/                 React + TypeScript frontend
  components/         UI (editor, pdf, ai, layout, files, …)
  lib/               framework-agnostic helpers (ai-providers, github, …)
  store/             Zustand state slices
src-tauri/src/       Rust backend (Tauri commands)
  commands.rs        compile pipeline (Tectonic sidecar)
  project.rs         project/file CRUD (path-sandboxed - see `resolve`)
  git.rs             git integration
  github.rs          GitHub OAuth device flow
  paths.rs           path helpers + project-id validation
docs/                user-facing documentation
scripts/             tooling (Tectonic fetch, icon gen)
```

## Tests

```bash
pnpm test                    # frontend unit tests (Vitest)
cd src-tauri && cargo test --lib   # Rust backend tests
```

Backend logic that touches the filesystem, git, or user paths **must** have a
test. The path-sandboxing helpers (`resolve_within`, `validate_project_id`) and
log/URL parsers are covered in `#[cfg(test)]` modules - extend them when you
change that code. On the frontend, the LaTeX masking that decides what the
spell/grammar checker sees is pure and unit-tested in
`src/components/editor/cm/latex-mask.test.ts` - add a case there when you change
what counts as prose.

## Code style

- **TypeScript** - the frontend must typecheck and build: `pnpm build`, and
  pass the Biome lint gate: `pnpm lint` (auto-fix what's safe with
  `pnpm lint:fix`). The gate **blocks** on correctness errors; an existing
  accessibility/style backlog is reported as non-blocking warnings (see
  `biome.json`). Prefer not adding new warnings.
- **Rust** - `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`. These currently run **advisory**
  (non-blocking) in CI because the tree isn't fully clean yet. If you'd like to
  help, a one-time `cargo fmt` + clippy-fix pass lets us flip them to blocking
  in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (drop `continue-on-error`, add `-D warnings`).
- Match the surrounding code - comment density, naming, and idiom.

## Pull requests

1. Fork and branch from `main` (`git checkout -b fix/short-description`).
2. Keep the change focused; unrelated refactors belong in their own PR.
3. Make sure `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, and `cargo test --lib` pass locally.
4. Fill out the PR template - link the issue, describe the change, note how you
   tested it.
5. CI must be green (the frontend build and Rust tests are required checks).

We squash-merge, so a clean PR title is the commit message. Conventional-commit
style is appreciated but not required (e.g. `fix: reject absolute paths in resolve`).

## Releases (maintainers)

Releases are cut by pushing a version tag; the
[`Release` workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds installers for macOS
(Apple Silicon + Intel), Windows, and Linux and attaches them to a **draft**
GitHub Release for review before publishing.

```bash
# Bump the version everywhere it's declared (package.json, Cargo.toml,
# Cargo.lock, tauri.conf.json) in one shot, so the tag can't drift:
./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.2.0

git commit -am "chore: release v0.2.0"
git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0
```
