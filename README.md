## Install

**Download the app** from the [latest release](https://github.com/prajwal-svm/OpenLeaf/releases/latest):

| Platform | Grab |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `.dmg` |
| Windows | `.msi` or `-setup.exe` |
| Linux | `.AppImage`, `.deb`, or `.rpm` |

Builds aren't code-signed yet, so your OS warns on first launch (it's safe to open). One-time unlock: on macOS run `/usr/bin/xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OpenLeaf.app`; on Windows click **More info**, then **Run anyway**; on Linux `chmod +x` the AppImage.

**Or build from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prajwal-svm/OpenLeaf.git && cd OpenLeaf

## Why OpenLeaf

You write LaTeX the way you write code, so your editor should treat it that way.

- It compiles on your machine. No server, no upload queue, no account.
- Your files live in a plain folder on your disk. Nothing leaves it unless you tell it to.
- Every project is a Git repo, and every save is a commit.
- AI is optional. Plug in your own key, or run a local model with Ollama, or turn it off.
- The files are just `.tex`, `.bib`, and images. Open them in any other editor whenever you want.
- It works with no internet at all.

You get the polish of a cloud editor without handing your documents to one.

<br/>

## What makes it different

**Git-backed history.** Every project is a Git repo. It auto-commits on save, shows side-by-side diffs, and restores any past version in one click. You can undo a change from three months ago, branch a resume, or blame a paragraph.

**Local, bring-your-own AI.** OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, or a local model through Ollama. Your prompts and documents don't touch a third party unless you pick one that does.

**Everything on disk.** No blob store, no lock-in. A project is just `~/.openleaf/projects/<id>/`, a normal folder with a real `.git` inside.

<br/>

## How it compares

| | OpenLeaf | Overleaf | VS Code + LaTeX Workshop |
|---|---|---|---|
| Works offline | Yes | No | Yes |
| Git built in | Yes | Add-on | Manual |
| Resume mode (ATS-clean, branchable) | Yes | Templates | No |
| AI assistant | Built-in · BYOK or local Ollama | Paid add-on | Extensions |
| Files stay on your disk | Yes | No | Yes |
| No account required | Yes | No | Yes |

Different tools, different bets. OpenLeaf's is that your documents belong on your machine, in Git, with AI you control and give access to.

<br/>

## Resume mode

Most LaTeX tools treat resumes as an afterthought. OpenLeaf doesn't.

- ATS-friendly by default. XeTeX with embedded fonts means the PDF parses cleanly in applicant-tracking systems.
- One-page templates that actually stay one page.
- Branch your resume: a `faang` branch, a `startup` branch, a `research` branch. Switch between them instantly.
- Paste a job posting and let the AI tailor your bullets to it.
- The PDF renders the same everywhere, so there are no "looked fine on my screen" surprises.

Version-control your career. One repo, every variant of you.

<br/>

## Research mode

The same engine that builds your resume handles serious academic work: papers, theses, CVs, books, articles, and grant proposals.

It handles multi-file projects, `\input` trees, `.bib` bibliographies, figures, and cross-references, with SyncTeX keeping the source and PDF in lockstep.

<br/>

## Accessible and ATS-ready, checked before you submit

Most LaTeX looks fine to a human and falls apart for a machine reader. A two-column layout reads across in a screen reader. An icon font hides your email from a resume parser. An untagged PDF fails Section 508 and PDF-UA outright. OpenLeaf catches all of this while you write, not after a rejection.

Open the Preflight panel and it scores your document out of 100 for the two audiences that fail on the same defects: applicant-tracking systems (ATS) and screen readers. It reads your source and your compiled PDF and shows you exactly what a machine sees.

- **ATS readiness.** A simulation of what an applicant-tracking system pulls from your resume PDF: name, email, phone, links, and which standard sections (Experience, Education, Skills) it detected, so you catch a section a parser can't see before a recruiter does.
- **Accessibility.** A Section 508 / PDF-UA verdict with a full tag-tree audit, plus source checks for multi-column layouts, missing image alt text, skipped heading levels, undescriptive links, and missing document language or title.
- **What the reader sees.** A plain-text preview of your compiled PDF in reading order, the exact thing a screen reader or parser gets.
- **One-click accessible export.** OpenLeaf rewrites your source with the setup a tagging engine needs and shows every change first. Compile with LuaLaTeX (use a TeX Live you already have, or install TinyTeX on demand, no admin rights) to produce a tagged, Section 508 / PDF-UA oriented PDF, then verify it right there.

We don't know another LaTeX editor that checks this for you. See [Preflight in the docs](docs/features.md#preflight-ats-and-accessibility-checks).

<br/>

## AI that understands LaTeX

The assistant can read your files, compile them, look at the resulting PDF, edit the source, and then check that its edit actually worked.

It also draws figures. Describe a diagram (or select a paragraph), and it generates the LaTeX, compiles just the figure in isolation, looks at the rendered result to fix overlaps and spacing, and inserts editable TikZ at your cursor. No AI key? A manual Figure Playground compiles and inserts figures offline.

| | |
|---|---|
| Explain a cryptic error | Rewrite a paragraph |
| Fix your bibliography | Suggest citations |
| Sharpen resume bullets | Tailor to a job description |
| Generate tables | Generate TikZ diagrams |
| Clean up formatting | Summarize a paper |

<br/>

## Features

The full list. Everything here runs on your machine. For the detailed tour, see [docs/features.md](docs/features.md).

**Editor (CodeMirror 6)**
- LaTeX autocomplete for commands, `\ref`/`\label`, `\cite` (parsed from your `.bib`), and file names from the tree
- Slash commands: type `/` for a Notion-style insert menu (`/figure`, `/table`, `/section`, `/cite`, `/math`)
- Find and replace (`⌘F`) with case, whole-word, and regex toggles, a live match count, and preserve-case replace; go to line with `⌘⇧L`
- Code folding for `\begin…\end` environments and section trees
- Vim mode, toggleable in Settings
- Offline spellcheck (Hunspell WASM) and grammar (Harper), masking commands, math, and comments so only prose is checked
- Compile errors surface as inline red squiggles and gutter marks

**Code intelligence (whole-project, not just the open file)**
- Go to definition (F12 or Cmd/Ctrl-click) for `\ref`, `\cite`, `\gls`, custom macros, and environments, across files
- Find references (Shift-F12) lists every use in a side panel
- Rename symbol (F2) updates a label, citation key, or macro everywhere at once, and warns on clashes
- Hover a `\ref`, `\cite`, or macro to see where it's defined
- The AI can read a project map (outline, labels, citations, macros, file graph)

**Compile and PDF**
- Tectonic (XeTeX) runs as a bundled sidecar, producing ATS-clean output with embedded subset fonts
- Debounced auto-compile (~2.5s) plus manual recompile with `⌘↵`
- Offline mode compiles with `--only-cached` and never touches the network
- pdf.js viewer with continuous scroll, single-page or two-page (spread) layouts, zoom (buttons or trackpad pinch), fit-to-width/height, page navigation (current/total, prev/next, jump-to), presentation mode, and an invert-colors toggle
- Bidirectional SyncTeX: Cmd/Ctrl-click a word in the PDF to land on that exact word in the source, or jump source-to-PDF with `⌘⇧J`
- The viewer is virtualized, so it stays smooth on documents hundreds of pages long (a thesis or a book)

**Preflight: ATS and accessibility checks**
- Two scores out of 100: ATS readiness and accessibility
- Source checks for multi-column layouts, missing image alt text, icon-hidden contact info, layout tables, skipped heading levels, undescriptive links, missing document language or PDF title, and more
- Output checks (after compiling) for reading order, garbled or unmapped text, and pages with no selectable text
- Plain-text preview of what a parser or screen reader actually sees, plus a simulated ATS extraction for resumes
- Reference and asset checks for undefined citations, duplicate labels, duplicate bib entries, and missing includes
- Prepare-for-accessible-export rewrites your document with the tagging setup a LuaLaTeX engine needs, showing every change first
- Optional LuaLaTeX engine: use an existing TeX Live or install TinyTeX (about 100 MB) on demand to compile and verify a tagged, Section 508 / PDF-UA oriented PDF

**Projects, files, and history**
- Library home with thumbnails, last-edited time, and export history
- Template gallery on new-project: browse by category with search, an ATS-friendly filter, and a live preview of each template. The starter set spans ATS-friendly resumes, a polished software engineer resume, a Modern resume in Lato, a photo-and-sidebar design resume, a full IEEE paper, ACM and Elsevier articles, a minimalist academic article, a thesis/report, a book, a Beamer deck, a research poster, a homework assignment, a newsletter, a monthly calendar, a bibliography starter, and a formal letter.
- On-demand fonts: templates that use premium open-source fonts (Lato, PT Sans, PT Serif) download them only when needed and copy them into the project, so the app stays small and documents stay self-contained. Manage downloads in Settings, Offline & Downloads.
- Source tree: create files and folders (nested to any depth), rename, delete, duplicate (files and whole folders), and reorganize by drag and drop; right-click a folder to add a file or folder inside it; upload files and set the main document
- Multi-file support for `\input`, images (PNG/JPG/PDF/EPS), and `.bib`, with editor tabs
- Autosave to disk shortly after you stop typing
- Every project is a Git repo with auto-commit on save, a full history view, side-by-side diffs, and one-click restore

**Source control and sync**
- Stage or discard changes, write a message, and Commit, Push, or Pull
- Publish to GitHub (new or existing repo) with ahead/behind indicators

**Citations**
- Paste a DOI, arXiv id, or URL to fetch an entry, or search Crossref by title
- OpenLeaf appends a correctly-keyed BibTeX entry (deduplicated by DOI) and inserts the `\cite` at your cursor
- Lookups send only the identifier or title, and respect offline mode

**AI assistant (bring your own model)**
- Reads and writes files, find-and-replace, create, rename, delete
- Compiles, reads the log, and extracts PDF text to verify its own edits
- Searches across projects, sets the main doc, toggles the theme
- Every file-changing edit pauses for approval with a red/green diff, and the decision stays in the chat
- Custom instructions, sandboxed so they can't reveal or override the built-in prompt
- Providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, Z.AI, or local Ollama

**Export and the rest**
- PDF export (always ATS-clean) and source-as-`.zip`
- Word (.docx), HTML, and Markdown via pandoc, installed separately
- Light and dark themes with Geist tokens, following your system setting
- Command palette (`⌘K`) to fuzzy-search every action
- In-app version display and update checker
- Full offline mode, no account, no telemetry

## Philosophy

> Your files belong to you.
>
> Every project is a folder. Every edit is Git history.
>
> No subscription and no account. Bring your own AI, or none at all.

## Architecture

The frontend is a pnpm workspace: nine `@openleaf/*` engine packages (editor, preview, diagram, preflight, AI tools, templates, …) behind injected ports, wired into the app shell through a contribution registry. The deep dive is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

```

OpenLeaf is local-first. A React webview draws the UI, a Rust core owns every
disk, process, and network call, and a bundled Tectonic engine does the
typesetting. The two halves only talk over Tauri's IPC, so nothing in the webview
reaches the filesystem or the network on its own.

**The core is the security boundary.** Every file the UI or the AI touches goes
through one Rust path guard. It rejects absolute paths, `..` traversal, and
symlink escapes, and it's scoped to a single project, so a crafted path or id
can't read or write outside its own folder. The GitHub token never reaches the
webview and never shows up in a git command's arguments; pushes authenticate
through an env-backed credential helper, and the config file is written
atomically at `0600`.

**Compiling.** A compile spawns the Tectonic (XeTeX) sidecar against a generated
wrapper that neutralizes pdfLaTeX-only primitives, streams the live TeX log to
the editor as it runs, parses the `.log` into structured errors, and hands back
the PDF as raw bytes. A companion SyncTeX layer reads the gzip-compressed
`.synctex.gz` and maps source to PDF both ways, so you can Cmd/Ctrl-click the PDF
to land on the source line, or move the cursor to highlight the rendered box.

**Checking prose without a LaTeX parser.** Grammar and spelling run entirely
offline (Harper and Hunspell, both WASM). The trick is masking: commands, math,
and comments get replaced with spaces before the checker sees the text, so it
only ever reads prose. An offset map then projects each finding back onto the
real source position.

**Understanding the whole project.** OpenLeaf keeps a live index of every file:
sections, labels, `\ref`/`\cite` uses, `.bib` keys, macros, and the `\input`
graph. It rebuilds incrementally as you type, so go-to-definition,
find-references, and project-wide rename work across files without a compile, and
the AI reads the same map instead of guessing from the open file alone.

**Preflight and tagged export.** A separate rules engine scores a document for
resume parsers (ATS) and screen readers. Source rules read the `.tex`; output
rules extract the compiled PDF's text and structure with pdf.js and audit its tag
tree. For real PDF/UA output there's an opt-in path that compiles with LuaLaTeX
(a system TeX Live, or an on-demand TinyTeX that installs to your home folder),
since the default Tectonic engine is XeTeX and can't emit tags.

**The AI agent.** The assistant is a multi-step tool loop, with your own OpenAI
or Anthropic key (or a local Ollama host, no key needed), that reads files, edits, compiles, and then reads
the rendered PDF text to check whether the edit actually worked. It commits a git
checkpoint before it touches anything, and any destructive change waits for your
approval before it hits disk.

**Shipping.** Builds go out for macOS, Windows, and Linux with a minisign-signed
update feed the app verifies before it installs anything.

## Roadmap

**Shipping next**
- [ ] Signed and notarized installers (macOS, Windows), so no first-launch warning
- [ ] Pre-warmed offline TeX bundle for a true zero-internet first run
- [ ] OS keychain for tokens and AI keys (beyond the on-disk `0600` store)
- [ ] One-click import from Overleaf or any Git repo

**The bigger bets**
- [ ] Collaboration over Git: branches, review, and comments for LaTeX. The Overleaf workflow, but local and yours.
- [ ] Track changes and inline comments, backed by real commits
- [ ] OpenLeaf on iPad and mobile (Tauri), so your repo travels with you
- [ ] A deeper AI agent: project-wide refactors, citation lookup from a claim, figures and TikZ from a description, "explain this paper"
- [ ] A plugin API for snippets, templates, and custom AI tools
- [ ] Timeline playback and semantic diffs (compare rendered output, not just source)
- [ ] Zotero and reference-manager integration, resume scoring against a job description
