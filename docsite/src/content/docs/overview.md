OpenLeaf is a free, local-first LaTeX editor and resume studio for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It gives you the full writing experience of a cloud LaTeX service, the compiler included, on your own machine: no account, no subscription, no upload, no waiting on someone else's build queue.

You write on the left, the PDF builds on the right, and everything in between is built in: citation lookups, accessibility checks, even an AI assistant that can edit your files with your approval.

## Who it's for

- **Researchers and academics** writing papers for IEEE, ACM, or Elsevier venues, with real bibliography management, cross-file navigation, and SyncTeX.
- **Students and PhD candidates** writing theses, reports, homework assignments, and Beamer presentations.
- **Job seekers** building resumes that actually survive applicant tracking systems. OpenLeaf ships ATS-friendly templates and a Preflight panel that simulates what a resume parser extracts from your PDF.
- **Anyone who wants beautiful typeset documents** without installing and maintaining a multi-gigabyte TeX distribution: books, posters, newsletters, letters, calendars, and standalone figures are all templates away.

## What you get

### A complete LaTeX environment, zero setup

The compiler ([Tectonic](/OpenLeaf/compiling/), XeTeX-based) ships inside the app. Packages download automatically the first time you use them and are cached forever after, so your second compile onward works fully offline. There is nothing to install, configure, or update by hand.

### A serious editor

CodeMirror 6 with LaTeX-aware [autocomplete and slash commands](/OpenLeaf/autocomplete/), a formatting [toolbar](/OpenLeaf/editor/), find and replace with regex and preserve-case, code folding, Vim mode, and offline [spelling and grammar checking](/OpenLeaf/spellcheck-grammar/) that understands LaTeX and skips your commands and math.

### Code intelligence across your whole project

Go to definition, find references, and project-wide rename for labels, citations, and macros. Hover a `\ref` or `\cite` to see what it points to. The [project index](/OpenLeaf/code-intelligence/) understands your `\input` graph, so navigation works across files.

### Live PDF preview with SyncTeX

A fast, virtualized [PDF preview](/OpenLeaf/pdf-preview/) with zoom, spreads, a detached window for your second monitor, and bidirectional [SyncTeX](/OpenLeaf/synctex/): jump from the cursor to the exact spot in the PDF, or Cmd/Ctrl-click a word in the PDF to land on it in the source.

### Citations without the copy-paste

Paste a DOI, an arXiv id, or a paper title. OpenLeaf fetches the BibTeX, deduplicates it against your `.bib`, and inserts the `\cite` at your cursor. [Citation lookup](/OpenLeaf/citations/) talks directly to doi.org, arXiv, and Crossref.

### Figures, drawn or generated

A built-in [diagram composer](/OpenLeaf/figures-diagrams/) with a visual editor and a TikZ code editor, live compiled preview, and round-trip editing. Or [draw with AI](/OpenLeaf/ai-figures/): describe a figure, and the assistant drafts TikZ, compiles it in isolation, and refines it until it looks right.

### Preflight: ATS and accessibility checks

Before you submit, [Preflight](/OpenLeaf/preflight/) scores your document for resume parsers and screen readers, shows you exactly what an ATS extracts from your PDF, finds undefined references and duplicate labels, and can prepare your source for a tagged, Section 508 / PDF-UA oriented export.

### An AI assistant that does real work

Bring your own key from any of nine providers, or run fully local with Ollama. The [assistant](/OpenLeaf/ai-chat/) reads your project, edits files (every change pauses for your approval with a diff), compiles, reads the log, and verifies the output. It fixes LaTeX errors, restructures sections, and answers questions about your own paper.

### Your history, in real Git

Every project is a plain folder with a real Git repository. Stage, commit, diff, and restore from the [Source Control panel](/OpenLeaf/git-history/), and [sync to GitHub](/OpenLeaf/github-sync/) to back up or move between machines.

### Export to wherever the document has to go

PDF always, plus Word, HTML, Markdown, and plain text via pandoc (fetched on demand), PowerPoint for Beamer decks, and EPUB for books. See [Export formats](/OpenLeaf/export/).

## Where everything lives

Your projects are plain folders under `~/.openleaf/projects/`, each with your `.tex`, `.bib`, images, and a `.git` history. No proprietary formats, no lock-in: back them up, copy them, or open them with any other tool whenever you like. See [Where your data lives](/OpenLeaf/where-your-data-lives/).

## Start here

1. [Download and install](/OpenLeaf/install/) for your platform.
2. Follow [Getting started](/OpenLeaf/getting-started/): first project to first PDF in about two minutes.
3. Browse the [templates](/OpenLeaf/templates/) to see what OpenLeaf can produce out of the box.
