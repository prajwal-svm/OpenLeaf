Open Settings from the gear in the rail, `/settings` in the search omnibar, or **Open settings** in the ⌘K palette. Ten sections in the left nav; this page walks all of them.

## Appearance

| Setting | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dark mode** | Toggle | Follows your OS | Light or dark theme. Also togglable from the rail and the ⌘K palette. |
| **Editor font size** | 11 to 20 px | 13px | Text size in the code editor. |
| **App font size** | 13 to 20 px | 16px | Scales the whole interface: menus, panels, buttons. |
| **App font** | Select | System default | Interface font: Inter, Helvetica Neue, Segoe UI, Georgia, or system. |
| **Editor font** | Select | System default | Editor monospace: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Cascadia Code, SF Mono, Menlo, Consolas, or system. |
| **Open projects in** | Select | Split view | The layout a project opens with: Split view, Editor only, or PDF only. |
| **Show file tree on open** | Toggle | On | Reveal the Source Tree whenever a project opens. |
| **Preview PDF on hover** | Toggle | On | The library's page-one [hover previews](/OpenLeaf/library/#hover-previews). |
| **Accent color** | Swatches | Blue | The highlight color everywhere: Blue, Green, Purple, Rose, Orange, or Teal. |

## General

| Setting | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vim mode** | Toggle | Off | Full Vim keybindings in the editor. |
| **Spellcheck** | Toggle | On | Hunspell spelling underlines; active only when Harper is off. |
| **Spelling, grammar & style (Harper)** | Toggle | On | The full offline [grammar checker](/OpenLeaf/spellcheck-grammar/). |
| **Regionalism suggestions** | Toggle | On | Flag British vs. American usage (shown when Harper is on). |
| **Word-choice suggestions** | Toggle | On | Catch word mix-ups like "too" vs. "to" (shown when Harper is on). |
| **Offline mode** | Toggle | Off | Compile with `--only-cached`; the compiler never touches the network, and [citation lookups](/OpenLeaf/citations/) are blocked. |

Also here: a **Shortcuts** row that opens the keyboard reference, and **Reset settings**, which restores Appearance and General to factory defaults (with a confirmation).

## Dictionary

Every word you told the [spellchecker](/OpenLeaf/spellcheck-grammar/#fixing-and-ignoring) to ignore, in two groups: **This project** and **All projects**. Remove a chip to start flagging that word again.

## Data Storage

Informational: shows where your library lives on disk (`~/.openleaf/projects`) and explains the local-first layout, with a shortcut to the GitHub section. The full story is on [Where your data lives](/OpenLeaf/where-your-data-lives/).

## AI Assistant

Provider cards for all nine providers, the model picker, the Ollama detector, custom instructions, and a reference list of the assistant's tools. Documented in depth on [Set up AI](/OpenLeaf/ai-setup/).

## LaTeX Engine

The tagged/accessible export engine: system LuaLaTeX detection, the one-click **Install TinyTeX (~100 MB)** (and its delete button), and the `tlmgr` package manager with tagging-compatibility badges. Documented on [LaTeX engines & packages](/OpenLeaf/latex-engines/).

## Offline & Downloads

The on-demand font packs used by richer [templates](/OpenLeaf/templates/#on-demand-fonts-the-setup-badge): each row shows the font, its size, its open-source license, and a **Download** or **Remove** button, plus a **Download all** for pre-loading everything before a flight. (The LuaLaTeX engine has its own section above.)

## GitHub

Account connection (device flow or personal access token) and, with a project open, that project's repository controls: remote URL, **Push**, **Pull**, **Unlink**, and **Create & link**. Documented on [GitHub sync](/OpenLeaf/github-sync/).

## MCP

Turn Oleafly into a local MCP server so an external agent (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Grok) can drive your project with no API key. **Enable MCP server**, the port (default `5323`), the bearer token (Reveal / Copy / Regenerate), copy-paste connection snippets, the **approval policy** and **Read-only mode**, and pointers to the `mcp.json` on disk all live here. Documented on [Connect via MCP](/OpenLeaf/mcp/).

## Help & About

- Version info and the **Check for updates** flow ([Updates](/OpenLeaf/updates/)).
- **Copy version & system info**: one click to copy exactly what a bug report needs.
- Resources: Documentation, Keyboard shortcuts, Report a bug, Report a crash (with log pointers), What's new, and the License.

## Where settings live

App preferences are per-machine (stored locally, like everything else). Project-specific state (name, main document, cover color) lives in each project's own `project.json`, so it travels with the project.
