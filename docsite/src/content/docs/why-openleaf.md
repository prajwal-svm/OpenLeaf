There are many ways to produce a LaTeX document. This page is an honest map of where OpenLeaf sits among them, what it does better, and what it deliberately does not try to be.

The short version: OpenLeaf pairs the polish of a cloud LaTeX service with the ownership of a desktop app, and adds things none of the alternatives have in one place: ATS and accessibility preflight, an approval-gated AI agent, DOI-to-`\cite` citation lookup, and a visual TikZ composer.

## vs Overleaf

Overleaf is the reference cloud LaTeX editor, and it is excellent at real-time multi-user collaboration. OpenLeaf is what you reach for when the cloud is the problem rather than the solution.

| | OpenLeaf | Overleaf |
|---|---|---|
| Where your files live | Your disk, plain folder + Git repo | Their servers |
| Works offline | Fully, including compile | No |
| Compile | Local, no queue, your hardware | Server-side, time limits on free tier |
| Account required | None | Yes |
| Price | Free, open source (AGPL) | Free tier + subscriptions |
| Version history | Full Git history, free | Limited on free tier |
| GitHub sync | Built in, free | Paid feature |
| AI | Bring your own key, or local via Ollama | Their AI assistant, paid tiers |
| Real-time multi-user editing | No | Yes, its core strength |
| ATS / accessibility preflight | Built in | No |

If your daily reality is "three co-authors typing in the same paragraph," Overleaf remains the right tool, and because OpenLeaf projects are Git repos, using both (OpenLeaf locally, Overleaf's Git bridge remotely) is practical.

## vs VS Code + LaTeX Workshop

The VS Code route is powerful and endlessly configurable, but you assemble it yourself: a TeX distribution (TeX Live or MiKTeX, often several gigabytes), the extension, a PDF viewer, latexmk configuration, and your own bibliography tooling.

OpenLeaf gives you the parts that setup never quite delivers, with zero configuration:

- The compiler ships in the app; packages fetch on demand. No TeX Live maintenance, ever.
- Citation lookup that turns a DOI or title into a deduplicated BibTeX entry and a `\cite` at your cursor.
- A visual diagram composer that generates editable TikZ, plus AI figure generation.
- Preflight checks for resume parsers and screen readers.
- An AI assistant wired to your project with tools and approval gates, not just chat in a sidebar.
- Project-wide rename, go to definition, and hover cards tuned specifically for LaTeX labels, citations, and macros.

If you live in VS Code for code and want your thesis in the same keybindings with heavy customization, LaTeX Workshop is a fine choice. OpenLeaf even meets you halfway: Vim mode is one toggle away.

## vs TeXstudio / TeXmaker

TeXstudio and TeXmaker are capable, mature desktop editors. Like the VS Code route, they require you to install and maintain a TeX distribution separately, and their interaction model has aged: dialog-heavy configuration, no integrated version control, no AI, and no template gallery.

OpenLeaf is what a desktop LaTeX editor looks like designed today: bundled compiler, a template gallery with 19 starting points, Git history built in, GitHub sync, citation lookup, code intelligence, and a fast interface with light and dark themes.

## vs Word, Google Docs, and resume builders

For resumes specifically, word processors and web resume builders have two chronic problems: layout drift (the file looks different on someone else's machine) and ATS damage (columns, tables, text boxes, and icon fonts that silently destroy what a parser extracts).

OpenLeaf's answer:

- LaTeX output is deterministic. The PDF is the PDF.
- The compiler emits real selectable Unicode text with embedded fonts, which is what parsers need.
- The ATS-friendly resume templates follow single-column, linear-reading-order rules.
- [Preflight](/OpenLeaf/preflight/) shows you the parsed result: name, email, phone, links, and which sections an ATS actually detected in your PDF.

For long-form academic writing, the comparison barely needs making: numbered references, cross-references, equations, and journal classes are what LaTeX exists for.

## What OpenLeaf does not do (yet)

Honesty cuts both ways:

- **No real-time multi-user editing.** Collaboration today is Git-based: push, pull, branch, review. Cloud sync is on the roadmap.
- **No in-app merge conflict resolver.** Conflicts surface as Git output; you resolve them like any Git conflict.
- **English-only spellcheck and grammar** for now.

If one of these is your hard requirement, the comparisons above should help you pick the right tool. For everything else, [get started](/OpenLeaf/getting-started/): the download is free and the first PDF takes about two minutes.
