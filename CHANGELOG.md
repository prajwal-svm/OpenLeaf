# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenLeaf are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Diff-preview approval for agent edits** - when the assistant proposes a
  `write_file`, `replace_in_file`, or `create_file` change, the approval prompt
  now shows a real red/green diff of exactly what will change instead of a
  one-line summary. Approve or reject decisions leave a persistent trace in the
  chat (an Approved / Rejected badge on the tool step).
- **Custom AI instructions** - Settings → AI Assistant has a field for your own
  system prompt. It is sandboxed inside our prompt as untrusted preferences, so
  it tunes the assistant's behaviour without being able to override safety, the
  available tools, or reveal the built-in prompt.
- **Inline project rename** - click the project title in the top bar to rename
  it in place, with Save (Enter) and Cancel (Esc); clicking away cancels.
- **Developer context menu** - during `tauri dev`, right-clicking anywhere
  offers Refresh App and Inspect. It is stripped from production builds.

### Changed

- **Release notes render as markdown** - the in-app update prompt now formats
  release notes (headings, lists, links, code) instead of showing raw markdown.
- **Friendlier AI assistant** - the assistant now has a warmer personality, asks
  clarifying questions, and never uses em dashes.
- **AI provider settings collapse** - each provider is an accordion, and the
  active provider badge sits on the right.
- **Compile opens split view** - compiling while the PDF pane is closed now
  switches to split view so the result is visible.
- **Renamed panels** - "File Tree" is now "Source Tree" and "Editor View" is now
  "Source View".
- **No em dashes** - removed em dashes from all user-facing copy and AI output.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- **Inverse SyncTeX across multiple files** - Cmd/Ctrl-clicking the PDF opens the
  correct source file (an `\input` child) before jumping to the line.

## [0.1.0]

### Security

- **Path traversal fixed** - file commands now reject absolute paths and
  validate project ids, so a crafted path or id can no longer read, write, or
  delete files outside a project directory. Added symlink-escape defense.
- **Reduced webview privileges** - removed the unused `shell:allow-execute` and
  `shell:allow-spawn` capabilities; the LaTeX compiler runs Rust-side and never
  needed them.
- **Content Security Policy** - added a restrictive CSP (`script-src 'self'`,
  `object-src 'none'`) as defense-in-depth against script injection.
- **GitHub token hardening** - the token is no longer embedded in git remote
  URLs (where it could appear in `ps`/reflogs); it's now supplied to `git` via
  an environment-backed credential helper.
- **GitHub token never enters the webview** - the authenticated GitHub REST
  calls (current user, list/create repos) now run in the Rust core, which reads
  the token from disk; `get_config` no longer returns the token to the
  frontend (only a `github_connected` flag). A webview/XSS compromise can no
  longer read or exfiltrate the token.
- **Config written securely** - `config.json` (GitHub token, AI keys) is now
  written atomically at mode `0600` from creation, closing the brief
  world-readable window left by the previous write-then-chmod approach.
- **Hardened shell-out & parsing** - the pandoc export passes `--` before the
  document path so a crafted filename can't be read as a flag; several
  `unwrap()`s on untrusted input (git porcelain, SyncTeX/`f64` sorts) are now
  panic-safe.

### Added

- **AI edit approval** - when the assistant wants to write, replace, delete, or
  rename a file, it now pauses and asks for your approval inline (approve /
  reject) before touching disk. Non-destructive tools (read, compile, search)
  still run automatically.
- **Chat attachments** - attach images or files to a message to the AI from the
  composer (images need a vision-capable model). Only lightweight metadata is
  stored in history; the bytes never touch the localStorage quota.
- **Error & success toasts** - user-triggered actions (export, download,
  create/fork/delete project, save PDF) now surface failures as a visible
  toast instead of only writing to `~/.openleaf/app.log`. Lightweight,
  dependency-free (`notifyError` logs *and* toasts).
- **In-app auto-updates** - OpenLeaf checks for new releases on launch (and via
  About → Check for updates), then downloads, signature-verifies, installs, and
  restarts. Releases now ship signed updater artifacts and a `latest.json` feed.
  See `docs/updates.md`.
- **Frontend lint gate** - Biome runs in CI (`pnpm lint`), blocking on
  correctness errors while surfacing an accessibility/style backlog as
  non-blocking warnings.
- Continuous integration (frontend build + Rust tests) on every PR; the Rust
  job now blocks on `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -D warnings`, and the
  frontend job runs the Biome lint gate.

### Fixed

- **Offline compile crashing with "unexpected argument '--only-cached'"** - the
  offline-mode flag was placed before Tectonic's `compile` subcommand instead of
  after it. Fixed and covered by tests.
- **GitHub push failing with "Repository not found"** on machines that already
  have a cached `github.com` credential (macOS keychain or a global git
  credential helper). Git consulted that stale/other-account credential before
  our token; auth failed and GitHub masked it as a 404. Push/pull now reset the
  credential-helper chain so only OpenLeaf's token is used.

### Changed

- **License changed from MIT to Apache-2.0**, © Prajwal S Venkateshmurthy and
  contributors. Still permissive (free for commercial and open-source use) but
  with stronger, explicit attribution (a `NOTICE` file redistributors must
  keep) and a patent grant. Harper is added to the credits.
- **Faster PDF preview** - compiled PDFs now transfer over IPC as raw bytes
  instead of base64 (drops the ~33% size inflation and a main-thread decode on
  every compile).
- **Smoother large documents** - the grammar/spell pass is skipped above a
  generous size threshold so a book-length file no longer janks the editor.
- Cross-platform release pipeline producing downloadable installers for macOS
  (Apple Silicon + Intel), Windows, and Linux.
- Contributor docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  issue/PR templates.
- Regression tests for path sandboxing (`resolve_within`, `validate_project_id`).

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release: local-first LaTeX & resume authoring with Tectonic
  compilation, SyncTeX, Git integration, GitHub sync, and bring-your-own-key AI
  assistance.
