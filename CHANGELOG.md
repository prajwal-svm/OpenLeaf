# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenLeaf are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **Path traversal fixed** - file commands now reject absolute paths and
  validate project ids, so a crafted path or id can no longer read, write, or
  delete files outside a project directory. Added symlink-escape defense.
- **Reduced webview privileges** - removed the unused `shell:allow-execute` and
  `shell:allow-spawn` capabilities; the LaTeX compiler runs Rust-side and never
  needed them.
- **Content Security Policy** - added a restrictive CSP (`script-src 'self'`,
  `object-src 'none'`) as defense-in-depth against script injection.
- **GitHub token hardening** - the token is no longer embedded in git remote
  URLs (where it could appear in `ps`/reflogs); it's now supplied to `git` via
  an environment-backed credential helper.

### Added

- **In-app auto-updates** - OpenLeaf checks for new releases on launch (and via
  About → Check for updates), then downloads, signature-verifies, installs, and
  restarts. Releases now ship signed updater artifacts and a `latest.json` feed.
  See `docs/updates.md`.
- **Frontend lint gate** - Biome runs in CI (`pnpm lint`), blocking on
  correctness errors while surfacing an accessibility/style backlog as
  non-blocking warnings.
- Continuous integration (frontend build + Rust tests) on every PR.
- Cross-platform release pipeline producing downloadable installers for macOS
  (Apple Silicon + Intel), Windows, and Linux.
- Contributor docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  issue/PR templates.
- Regression tests for path sandboxing (`resolve_within`, `validate_project_id`).

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release: local-first LaTeX & resume authoring with Tectonic
  compilation, SyncTeX, Git integration, GitHub sync, and bring-your-own-key AI
  assistance.
