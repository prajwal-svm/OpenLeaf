# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenLeaf are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added self-contained E2E sidecar preparation that detects the Rust host, validates pinned Typst and Tectonic versions, and installs missing binaries before the app starts.
- Introduced a Rust `DocumentEngine` abstraction that gives LaTeX, Typst, and Markdown one supervised compile contract with normalized artifacts, diagnostics, executable provenance, and capabilities.
- Added first-class Typst projects with editor support, parsing and indexing, templates, AI context, preflight integration, and PDF compilation.
- Added Markdown projects through managed Pandoc with bundled Tectonic, citeproc bibliography support, document conversion exports, templates, indexing, AI context, and PDF compilation.
- Added pinned, checksum-verified Typst, Pandoc, and Tectonic acquisition with exact archive-member extraction and cross-platform release smoke infrastructure.

### Changed

- Reduced startup payloads by loading Harper as WebAssembly on demand, consolidating PDF rendering onto one worker, and deferring editor, preview, and AI surfaces until they are opened.
- Added enforced production bundle budgets for JavaScript, CSS, Harper WebAssembly, and PDF worker count.
- Verified 141 native macOS E2E scenarios with zero retries/skips and recorded
  final production bundle measurements.
- Improved keyboard, focus, labeling, and semantic control behavior across dialogs, menus, project cards, search, preflight, tooltips, and editor surfaces.
- Positioned 0.2.5 explicitly as an unsigned developer beta and documented updater failure behavior and manual rollback.
- Limited supported release targets to macOS Apple Silicon, Windows x64, and Linux x64, removing unsupported macOS downloader and CI paths.
- Aligned public and private documentation with authenticated encrypted local storage for AI, GitHub, and MCP credentials, including its same-user threat-model limitation.
- Generalized templates, AI tools and prompts, preflight coverage, formatting, citations, exports, SyncTeX, figures, and UI controls around typed engine capability flags.
- Strengthened project trust boundaries with transactional creation, persisted-engine validation, exact export authorization, safer archive extraction, and fail-closed capability loading.
- Improved release trust through consistent AGPL documentation, dependency auditing, accessibility fixes, PDF lifecycle cleanup, bounded caches and logs, serialized chat persistence, and supervised process-tree termination.
- Preserved cross-platform behavior with managed compiler discovery and installation, native Windows atomic chat replacement, and platform-specific process cleanup.

### Fixed

- Fixed diagram edge edits clearing selection and hiding the style pane; dotted
  lines, arrow direction, routing, and connection-side anchors now carry through
  to generated TikZ.
- Fixed a race where chat submitted immediately after saving custom AI
  instructions could use the previous persisted prompt.

- Added native E2E coverage that verifies source edits, full replacements, and reversions change the compiled PDF, with extraction failures reported instead of accepted as blank output.
- Serialized encrypted-secret transactions across threads and processes, made first-run key creation atomic, eliminated shared temporary paths, and surfaced corrupted GitHub and MCP secret storage instead of treating it as missing credentials.
- Removed repeated OS authorization prompts for AI providers by moving AI credentials into an authenticated encrypted owner-only local store.
- Made interrupted E2E runs release their process tree, port, socket, and shared runner lock, with bounded TERM-to-KILL escalation.
- Reused checksum-validated sidecar archives without executing untrusted existing binaries or downloading trusted assets again.
- Removed pipefail-sensitive version probes and tightened E2E recovery, error-boundary, palette, and settings selector coverage.
- Verified and replaced native E2E sidecars before execution, closed runner ownership races, and limited cleanup to the process tree started by each run.
- Restored stable settings automation coverage for editor font and default project layout controls.
- Applied the PDF worker compatibility layer to one-shot page rasterization, preventing diagram and image previews from hanging in older native WebViews.
- Prevented overlapping desktop E2E runners from sharing and terminating the same app bridge by acquiring an atomic process-owned runner lock before sidecar setup or process cleanup, then removing only the bridge socket whose filesystem identity belongs to that run.
- Bound delayed streaming chat snapshots to their originating chat so opening or starting another conversation cannot redirect a pending save.
- Normalized bare AI-generated TikZ commands into complete `tikzpicture` environments before isolated preview and document insertion.
- Preserved streamed model reasoning in tool-call continuation requests so reasoning providers can reliably process real tool results.
- Made template creation and appearance-settings E2E flows wait for visible application readiness before performing real user interactions.
- Made the Vim persistence journey establish its initial state through the command palette when WebView preferences survive an interrupted run.
- Kept compile failures visible in the preview status before any successful compile and made the real error-recovery journey restore its document after failed assertions.
- Reused validated PDF page text when rendering selectable layers, preventing a second pdf.js worker stream from leaving text selection and inverse SyncTeX blank after a successful canvas render.
- Refreshed capability-gated command palette entries after engine metadata or the active source file changes.
- Replaced modal E2E shortcuts through hidden DOM state with independent keyboard and focus-restoration flows available to users.
- Restored an accessible Home label on the editor control that returns to the project library.
- Prevented the file tree from returning an unstable empty Zustand snapshot while engine metadata loads, which crashed the project editor with a maximum update-depth error.
- Added checksum-pinned Typst acquisition for ARM Linux development hosts.
- Corrected the managed Windows Pandoc archive member to `pandoc-3.9.0.2/pandoc.exe` and added exact ZIP extraction regressions for valid, basename-only, wrong-version, and unsafe paths.
- Rejected symlinked or reparse-point project build directories before artifact cleanup, compiler execution, or output writes.
- Replaced Typst code-string masking with a linear lexical scan that remains bounded on marker-heavy lines.
- Deferred the initial preview compile until document engine metadata is loaded.
- Restored PDF pinch and Ctrl-wheel zoom after compiled output first appears.
- Limited editor bold and italic shortcuts to source files owned by the project engine.
- Restored the checksum-pinned Pandoc and Tectonic pipeline on ARM Linux.
- Kept the last successful PDF visible while recompiling and after compiler failures.
- Prevented delayed main-document updates from overwriting a newly opened project's engine state.
- Prevented the advanced-settings toggle from resetting the selected settings section.
- Limited Typst string masking to code expressions, preserving references in paired quotes, measurement quotes, and markup after code.
- Added Markdown-aware spell and grammar masking for code, links, URLs, and math while preserving percent prose.
- Restricted AI figure mode to LaTeX-capable projects.
- Restored accessible-source preparation before a PDF has been compiled.
- Removed contradictory compiled-PDF guidance from unsupported reference checks.
- Made stale build-artifact cleanup tolerant of transient file locks without hashing normal successful output or accepting unverifiable stale output.
- Moved compiler command preparation and Markdown dependency discovery off the asynchronous executor after compile request coalescing.
- Made bounded compiler-log truncation safe at multibyte UTF-8 boundaries.
- Fixed inline Typst raw highlighting and limited heading highlighting to line starts.
- Excluded email domains from Typst references and corrected Markdown heading spans and Setext detection.
- Indexed `.ltx` and `.latex` sources alongside `.tex` files.
- Limited LaTeX insertion commands and the LaTeX toolbar to active engine source files.
- Unified app and template modal coordination so only the top dialog handles Escape, backdrop input, focus containment, and restoration.
- Repositioned visible tooltips when their labels change.
- Released compile intent after failed Pandoc setup and invalidated pending compile results on reset.
- Deferred source preflight until engine metadata is loaded.
- Persisted AI token usage to the originating project when a run finishes after a project switch.
- Serialized chat mutations and durable saves per project, including cache-miss races and repeated Windows file replacement.
- Preserved combined chat messages and token usage when synchronous edits arrive before an earlier save promise resolves.
- Avoided probing the managed Pandoc binary twice.
- Kept exact-path export reveal authorization reusable within the session and raised its bounded capacity.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- MCP server: expose the built-in agent tools to external MCP clients with token
  auth and in-app approvals, a read-only mode, and three approval policies
  (confirm everything, auto-approve edits, or trust the connection). See
  [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).
- Automatic Git commits: every successful compile snapshots the project, and
  edits commit on their own after a short quiet period, under generated
  "Update: `<files>`" messages. Automatic commits pause while the Source
  Control panel is open, so manual staging is never disturbed.
- Agentic AI assistant: the chat panel plans multi-step work as a live todo
  checklist, keeps sticky per-project memory across chats and restarts, and
  shows a running input/output token count with a rough cost estimate as it
  streams.
- PDF vision check: the assistant can rasterize chosen PDF pages and inspect the
  rendered layout with a vision model (`verify_pdf_pages`), gated by a new
  "Allow PDF page capture" setting.
- Floating assistant: pop the assistant out of the rail into a draggable,
  resizable card over the editor, and dock it back. One shared conversation
  whether floated or docked.
- Inline AI edit: rewrite a selection in place from a prompt (Cmd/Ctrl+L) with a
  red/green preview, and hand off into the full chat agent when the change grows.
- Diagram editor: canvas zoom controls, a shape inspector, and inserting a
  drawing as editable TikZ (with a figure PNG) in the document.

### Fixed

- Recover from a wedged pdf.js worker in the PDF preview: retry on a fresh
  worker, probe the text pipe, and fall back to main-thread rendering, so text
  selection and inverse SyncTeX keep working late in a long editing session.
- Windows and Linux parity: process spawns no longer flash a console window,
  and asset downloads, path handling, file-manager reveal, the updater,
  secret-file permissions, and keyboard-shortcut labels behave correctly off
  macOS.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-11

### Changed

- **License changed from Apache-2.0 to AGPL-3.0-or-later.** OpenLeaf stays free
  and open source; the AGPL's network copyleft means anyone who distributes or
  hosts a modified version must share their source under the same license.
- **The frontend is now a pnpm workspace.** Feature engines moved into nine
  `@openleaf/*` packages (latex, ai-core, registry, editor, preview, diagram,
  preflight, ai-tools, templates) behind injected ports, and the app shell's
  rail tabs, palette/omnibar commands, and AI toolsets are now registered
  through a contribution registry instead of hard-wired lists. No user-facing
  behavior changed; see docs/architecture.md.

### Fixed

- The AI assistant's `toggle_theme` tool now actually switches the theme (its
  event had no listener before).
- Reasoning models over the Z.AI and DeepSeek providers no longer have their
  replies aborted mid-thought: their reasoning stream was dropped by the strict
  OpenAI provider, which starved the stall watchdog.
- The thinking indicator now shows for the whole AI run instead of appearing
  only after the first token, and a reply interrupted by closing the panel
  leaves a visible notice instead of vanishing.
- Renaming a file from the tree's context menu no longer closes its input box
  before you can type (the menu's closing focus jump committed the old name).
- Edits made within a second of closing or reloading the app are no longer
  lost; pending autosaves flush on the way out.
- The diagram composer and AI figure preview no longer freeze after a
  successful compile: PDF rasterization reuses one render worker with a
  watchdog instead of spawning a fresh one per preview (which could wedge).
- Requesting a recompile while a compile is already running now queues one
  rerun instead of being silently dropped, and stacked-up stale compile
  requests are skipped instead of running one after another.
- Forward SyncTeX jumps land reliably right after a recompile (the jump now
  retries while the preview's page registry rebuilds).
- A compile that hangs (for example on a stalled package download) is now
  killed after five minutes and reported, instead of blocking every following
  compile forever.
- Font files opened from the tree show a binary-file notice instead of a
  broken text editor, and settings deep-links open the requested section.

### Added

- **Library hover previews** - hovering a compiled project's book slides in a
  page-1 preview of its PDF, so you can tell documents apart at a glance. A
  bookmark-only filter sits beside the search box, and an appearance setting
  turns hover previews off.
- **Auto-compile on open** - opening a project whose layout shows the PDF pane
  compiles it immediately, so the preview is fresh without pressing anything.
- **Live reasoning view** - thinking models stream their reasoning into an
  auto-expanding card that collapses to "Thought for Ns" when the answer
  starts, and each reasoning phase interleaves with the tool calls it led to.
- **Copy button on chat bubbles** - hover any message to copy it.
- **Draw with AI (figures)** - turn a prompt or a selected paragraph into a
  publication-quality figure. The assistant drafts TikZ, compiles just the figure
  in isolation, and (on vision-capable models) looks at the rendered result to fix
  overlaps and spacing before inserting editable LaTeX at your cursor plus a
  `figures/<name>.png` copy. Text-only models refine from the compile log while you
  review the figure in the approval card. Open it from the spark icon in the AI
  panel, the omnibar ("Generate a figure with AI"), or right-click "Generate figure
  from selection".
- **Insert diagram (visual editor + code)** - a full-height composer beside the
  compile button (and in the omnibar) with a **Draw** tab (a React Flow visual
  editor: drag shapes, connect arrows, style colors, snap-to-grid, undo/redo) that
  generates clean TikZ live, and a **Code** tab (LaTeX-highlighted editor with a
  TikZ snippet toolbar). Compile to a live preview, then insert as vector code or a
  saved PNG (with scale and transparent-background options). Drawn diagrams
  round-trip: the saved `figures/<name>.tikz` embeds the model, so **Load** re-opens
  it fully editable. No AI required, works offline.
- **Image files render in the editor** - opening a `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, etc.
  now shows the actual image instead of loading its bytes into the text editor.
- **AI run timeout** - a chat/figure run that gets no response from the provider
  for 90 seconds now aborts itself with a clear message instead of spinning
  forever, and the "thinking" indicator surfaces a model's reasoning phase.
- **Command omnibar** - the search bar (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F, from anywhere) is now a
  Raycast-style palette: it finds your projects first, searches inside documents,
  and runs commands. Slash commands scope it: `/create` opens the template
  gallery, `/projects` searches projects, `/docs` searches document text, `/refs`
  opens references, `/theme` toggles the theme, and `/settings` opens settings.
  New projects can be created from anywhere, including inside a project.
- **Appearance preferences** - set a global app font size that scales the whole
  interface, pick the app and editor fonts (VS Code style), choose which view a
  project opens in (split, editor, or PDF), and whether the file tree shows on
  open.
- **Template name hints** - the project-name field suggests a fitting placeholder
  per template (an IEEE paper hints "Attention Is All You Need", a resume hints a
  person's name, and so on).
- **PDF compile progress** - the preview shows an animated progress readout while
  the first compile runs.
- **Template gallery** - creating a project now opens a browsable gallery,
  organized by category (CVs & Resumes, Journals & Conferences, Theses & Reports,
  Books, Presentations, Posters, Letters), with search, an ATS-friendly filter,
  and a page-1 preview of every template. Choose a template, then name the project
  and pick a cover color. The starter set includes clean ATS-friendly resumes, a
  polished software engineer resume, a Modern resume in the Lato typeface, and a
  photo-and-sidebar design resume; a full worked IEEE paper, ACM and Elsevier
  journal articles, and a minimalist academic article; a thesis/report, a book, a
  Beamer deck, a research poster, a homework assignment, a two-column newsletter, a
  monthly calendar, a bibliography starter, and a formal letter, covering the full
  range of categories you would find in an online template gallery.
- Templates now ship as editable on-disk source files (a bundled resource folder
  per template with a manifest), so the catalog can grow without code changes.
- **On-demand fonts.** Richer templates use premium open-source fonts (Lato, PT
  Sans, PT Serif) that are downloaded only when needed, keeping the installer
  small. When you create such a template, the fonts are fetched (with progress)
  and copied into the project's `fonts/` folder, so the document stays
  self-contained, portable, and compiles offline. A new Settings, Offline &
  Downloads section lets you pre-download fonts or remove them to free space.

- **More export formats, matched to the document.** Export now offers plain text
  alongside Word, HTML, and Markdown, and shows format options that fit the
  document: presentations (Beamer) can export to PowerPoint (`.pptx`), with each
  frame becoming a slide, and books, reports, and theses can export to EPUB
  (`.epub`) with a table of contents. HTML export is now a single self-contained
  file with math rendered as MathML.

### Changed

- The PDF preview's fullscreen now preserves your current view: in split view it
  fullscreens the whole window (editor and PDF, scrollable), and PDF-only view
  still gets the immersive presentation mode.
- A project's cover color is now saved to its `project.json` on disk, so it
  travels with the project across machines instead of living only in the browser.
- The preview toolbar's zoom buttons use magnifier icons.
- The full end-to-end test suite now runs in CI on macOS, Linux, and Windows
  against the real app, and the repository gained dependency, security-audit,
  and license gates (Dependabot, CodeQL, cargo-deny).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Source tree: folders and drag & drop** - create a file or folder inside a
  folder (right-click the folder, or select it and use the New buttons), nest
  folders to any depth, and drag files and folders in and out of folders to
  reorganize. Moving an open file keeps its tab and unsaved changes.
- **PDF page navigation** - the preview toolbar now shows the current page and
  total (like "6 of 100"), with previous and next buttons and a jump-to-page
  box, next to the zoom controls, so you can move through long documents without
  scrolling.
- **PDF view layouts** - a view toggle in the preview toolbar switches between
  single-page and two-page (spread) continuous scroll, like a desktop PDF
  reader.
- **Pinch to zoom the PDF** - a trackpad pinch zooms the preview in and out
  (only over the PDF area), alongside the existing zoom buttons.
- **Smooth large documents** - the PDF preview is virtualized: it only renders
  the pages near the viewport (with a hard cap, evicting the farthest), so a
  hundreds-of-pages thesis or book scrolls smoothly with bounded memory.
- **Auto-citation** - add a reference by pasting a DOI, arXiv id, or URL (fetched
  directly), or by typing a paper title to search Crossref and pick a result.
  OpenLeaf appends a correctly-keyed BibTeX entry to your project's .bib
  (deduplicated by DOI, so the same paper is never added twice) and inserts the
  \cite at your cursor. Open it from the command palette ("Add citation") or the
  citation button in the editor toolbar. Only the identifier or title is sent, to
  doi.org, arXiv, or Crossref, and it respects offline mode.
- **Duplicate bibliography detection** - the References check now flags two `.bib`
  entries that share a DOI (the same paper under two keys), and a References
  button was added to the sidebar rail to reopen the find-references results.

- **Code intelligence (project index)** - OpenLeaf now builds a live index of the
  whole project (sections, `\label`s, `\ref`/`\cite`s, `.bib` entries, `\newcommand`
  macros, theorems, glossary entries, and the `\input` graph). It powers:
  go-to-definition (F12 or Cmd/Ctrl-click) that jumps from a `\ref`, `\cite`, or
  macro use to its definition across files; find-references (Shift-F12) that lists
  every use in a side panel; and rename-refactor (F2) that renames a label,
  citation key, or macro and updates every use project-wide, with a collision
  check. The AI assistant also gains a project_map tool so it can reason about the
  whole document, not just the open file. The index rebuilds from an in-memory
  cache as you type, so it stays fresh without slowing editing. Hovering a
  reference shows what it points to, and Cmd/Ctrl-hover underlines it as a link.
- **VSCode-style find and replace** - `⌘F` now opens a compact widget with icon
  toggles for case, whole-word, and regex, a live match count, prev/next and
  select-all, and a collapsible replace row.
- **Code folding** - click the gutter arrow to collapse a `\begin...\end`
  environment or a section that folds until the next same-or-higher-level section.
  fold and unfold at the cursor with `Ctrl ⇧ [` / `Ctrl ⇧ ]`.

- **Preflight: ATS and accessibility checks** - a new Preflight panel (shield
  icon in the sidebar). It opens instantly and, like a page-speed report, lets
  you pick which checks to run: ATS readiness (for resumes) and Accessibility
  (for research and published PDFs), pre-selected to match your document. Run on
  demand and it reads your source and compiled PDF and reports how ready the
  document is: an ATS-readiness score and an accessibility score, flagging issues
  like two-column layouts, missing image alt text, icons that hide contact info,
  garbled ligatures, and missing PDF language or title, plus a "what the reader
  sees" plain-text preview of the compiled PDF. Source-level issues also appear
  as inline squiggles in the editor. Checks are a readiness aid, not a formal
  accessibility certification.
- **Preflight: what a parser extracted** - for resumes, Preflight now simulates
  what an Applicant Tracking System pulls from your compiled PDF: the name,
  email, phone, and links it captured, and which standard sections (Experience,
  Education, Skills, and so on) it could detect, so you can see at a glance if a
  parser would miss your contact details or work history.
- **Preflight: output accessibility verdict** - after compiling, Preflight gives
  a clear answer on whether the PDF is Section 508 / PDF-UA ready. When a tagged
  PDF is present it audits the tag tree (figure alt text, table headers, heading
  nesting); on untagged output it says so plainly instead of leaving you
  guessing. Findings are now grouped into Source and Compiled output.
- **Preflight: prepare for accessible export** - one click rewrites your
  document into a form a tagging engine can turn into a Section 508 / PDF-UA
  ready PDF: it adds the required \DocumentMetadata first line, unicode-math,
  and alt-text placeholders, and warns about packages that break tagging. It
  shows every change before you apply it, so nothing happens without your
  say-so. Compile the prepared source with LuaLaTeX (TeX Live 2025 or newer),
  then let Preflight verify the tagged output.
- **Optional LuaLaTeX engine for tagged export** - a new Settings, LaTeX Engine
  section. OpenLeaf uses a LuaLaTeX / TeX Live you already have, or installs
  TinyTeX (about 100 MB) on demand, in your home folder with no admin rights,
  and lets you delete it to free space. A built-in package manager (tlmgr) adds
  or removes LaTeX packages, with each package tagged for tagging compatibility.
  With an engine present, Preflight can compile a tagged PDF and verify it in one
  step. The default Tectonic engine is unchanged for everyone who does not need
  tagging.

### Fixed

- **Editor clipboard on macOS** - Cmd+C / Cmd+V / Cmd+X / Cmd+A work in the
  editor again. The custom application menu had replaced the default one and
  dropped the native Edit menu whose predefined items bind those shortcuts.
- **Precise inverse SyncTeX** - Cmd/Ctrl-clicking a word in the PDF now places
  the cursor on that exact word in the source, instead of the start of the line
  (which often landed on a `\begin`/`\end`).
- **Editor and settings polish** - removed the redundant filename row under the
  editor toolbar (the open tab already shows it); in Settings, Help & About the
  Documentation link opens the docs site and License opens the LICENSE file.
- **Copy a folder** - "Make a copy" now recursively copies a folder and its
  contents; it previously only worked on files (and silently failed on folders).
- **Editor tabs: activation and order** - clicking a file (in the source tree or
  its tab) now makes it the active view; with a git diff open, the file used to
  open behind the diff and never activate. File and diff tabs also share one
  strip in the order they were opened, instead of files-left / diffs-right, and
  re-opening a tab keeps its position.

## [0.2.1]

### Added

- **Dedicated update window** - when a new version is available, OpenLeaf opens
  its own branded, frameless window (instead of a native OS dialog) showing the
  changelog for the new version, with a one-click Update now that downloads,
  installs, and restarts.
- **Streamlined macOS menu** - the menu bar now shows a single OpenLeaf menu
  with About OpenLeaf, Check for Updates, and Quit.
- **Update-check indicator** - the About panel now flags when an automatic
  update check has failed, so an otherwise-silent failure is visible.

### Changed

- **Release notes come from the changelog** - the update window and the GitHub
  release now lead with what actually changed (drawn from this file), with
  install help as a link rather than the headline.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Diff-preview approval for agent edits** - when the assistant proposes a
  `write_file`, `replace_in_file`, or `create_file` change, the approval prompt
  now shows a real red/green diff of exactly what will change instead of a
  one-line summary. Approve or reject decisions leave a persistent trace in the
  chat (an Approved / Rejected badge on the tool step).
- **Custom AI instructions** - Settings → AI Assistant has a field for your own
  system prompt. It is sandboxed inside our prompt as untrusted preferences, so
  it tunes the assistant's behaviour without being able to override safety, the
  available tools, or reveal the built-in prompt.
- **Inline project rename** - click the project title in the top bar to rename
  it in place, with Save (Enter) and Cancel (Esc); clicking away cancels.
- **Developer context menu** - during `tauri dev`, right-clicking anywhere
  offers Refresh App and Inspect. It is stripped from production builds.

### Changed

- **Release notes render as markdown** - the in-app update prompt now formats
  release notes (headings, lists, links, code) instead of showing raw markdown.
- **Friendlier AI assistant** - the assistant now has a warmer personality, asks
  clarifying questions, and never uses em dashes.
- **AI provider settings collapse** - each provider is an accordion, and the
  active provider badge sits on the right.
- **Compile opens split view** - compiling while the PDF pane is closed now
  switches to split view so the result is visible.
- **Renamed panels** - "File Tree" is now "Source Tree" and "Editor View" is now
  "Source View".
- **No em dashes** - removed em dashes from all user-facing copy and AI output.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- **Inverse SyncTeX across multiple files** - Cmd/Ctrl-clicking the PDF opens the
  correct source file (an `\input` child) before jumping to the line.

## [0.1.0]

### Security

- **Path traversal fixed** - file commands now reject absolute paths and
  validate project ids, so a crafted path or id can no longer read, write, or
  delete files outside a project directory. Added symlink-escape defense.
- **Reduced webview privileges** - removed the unused `shell:allow-execute` and
  `shell:allow-spawn` capabilities; the LaTeX compiler runs Rust-side and never
  needed them.
- **Content Security Policy** - added a restrictive CSP (`script-src 'self'`,
  `object-src 'none'`) as defense-in-depth against script injection.
- **GitHub token hardening** - the token is no longer embedded in git remote
  URLs (where it could appear in `ps`/reflogs); it's now supplied to `git` via
  an environment-backed credential helper.
- **GitHub token never enters the webview** - the authenticated GitHub REST
  calls (current user, list/create repos) now run in the Rust core, which reads
  the token from disk; `get_config` no longer returns the token to the
  frontend (only a `github_connected` flag). A webview/XSS compromise can no
  longer read or exfiltrate the token.
- **Config written securely** - `config.json` (GitHub token, AI keys) is now
  written atomically at mode `0600` from creation, closing the brief
  world-readable window left by the previous write-then-chmod approach.
- **Hardened shell-out & parsing** - the pandoc export passes `--` before the
  document path so a crafted filename can't be read as a flag; several
  `unwrap()`s on untrusted input (git porcelain, SyncTeX/`f64` sorts) are now
  panic-safe.

### Added

- **AI edit approval** - when the assistant wants to write, replace, delete, or
  rename a file, it now pauses and asks for your approval inline (approve /
  reject) before touching disk. Non-destructive tools (read, compile, search)
  still run automatically.
- **Chat attachments** - attach images or files to a message to the AI from the
  composer (images need a vision-capable model). Only lightweight metadata is
  stored in history; the bytes never touch the localStorage quota.
- **Error & success toasts** - user-triggered actions (export, download,
  create/fork/delete project, save PDF) now surface failures as a visible
  toast instead of only writing to `~/.openleaf/app.log`. Lightweight,
  dependency-free (`notifyError` logs *and* toasts).
- **In-app auto-updates** - OpenLeaf checks for new releases on launch (and via
  About → Check for updates), then downloads, signature-verifies, installs, and
  restarts. Releases now ship signed updater artifacts and a `latest.json` feed.
  See `docs/updates.md`.
- **Frontend lint gate** - Biome runs in CI (`pnpm lint`), blocking on
  correctness errors while surfacing an accessibility/style backlog as
  non-blocking warnings.
- Continuous integration (frontend build + Rust tests) on every PR; the Rust
  job now blocks on `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -D warnings`, and the
  frontend job runs the Biome lint gate.

### Fixed

- **Offline compile crashing with "unexpected argument '--only-cached'"** - the
  offline-mode flag was placed before Tectonic's `compile` subcommand instead of
  after it. Fixed and covered by tests.
- **GitHub push failing with "Repository not found"** on machines that already
  have a cached `github.com` credential (macOS keychain or a global git
  credential helper). Git consulted that stale/other-account credential before
  our token; auth failed and GitHub masked it as a 404. Push/pull now reset the
  credential-helper chain so only OpenLeaf's token is used.

### Changed

- **License changed from MIT to Apache-2.0**, © Prajwal S Venkateshmurthy and
  contributors. Still permissive (free for commercial and open-source use) but
  with stronger, explicit attribution (a `NOTICE` file redistributors must
  keep) and a patent grant. Harper is added to the credits.
- **Faster PDF preview** - compiled PDFs now transfer over IPC as raw bytes
  instead of base64 (drops the ~33% size inflation and a main-thread decode on
  every compile).
- **Smoother large documents** - the grammar/spell pass is skipped above a
  generous size threshold so a book-length file no longer janks the editor.
- Cross-platform release pipeline producing downloadable installers for macOS
  Apple Silicon, Windows x64, and Linux x64.
- Contributor docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  issue/PR templates.
- Regression tests for path sandboxing (`resolve_within`, `validate_project_id`).

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release: local-first LaTeX & resume authoring with Tectonic
  compilation, SyncTeX, Git integration, GitHub sync, and bring-your-own-key AI
  assistance.
