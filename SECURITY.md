# Security Policy

OpenLeaf is a local-first desktop app: your documents, GitHub token, and AI API
keys live on your machine. We take the integrity of that boundary seriously.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not report security issues in public GitHub issues, discussions, or
pull requests.**

Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**
   (or open <https://github.com/prajwal-svm/OpenLeaf/security/advisories/new>).
2. Describe the issue, the affected version/commit, and reproduction steps.

We aim to acknowledge a report within **72 hours** and to ship a fix or
mitigation for confirmed high-severity issues as quickly as we reasonably can.
We'll credit you in the release notes unless you'd prefer to stay anonymous.

## Scope - what we especially care about

Because the frontend can drive privileged Rust commands, we're most interested
in reports about:

- **Path/sandbox escapes** - reading, writing, or deleting files outside a
  project directory (e.g. via crafted paths or project ids, symlinks, or
  traversal). File access is meant to stay within `~/.openleaf/projects/<id>/`.
- **Command execution** - getting the app to run arbitrary programs or shell
  commands.
- **Secret exposure** - leaking the stored GitHub token or AI API keys (from
  `~/.openleaf/config.json`, process arguments, logs, or the network).
- **Webview escapes / XSS** - script injection via rendered AI output, compile
  logs, PDF content, or file contents, bypassing the app's Content Security
  Policy.

## Known limitations (by design, for now)

These are documented trade-offs, not vulnerabilities - though we welcome help
improving them:

- **Secrets at rest** - the GitHub token and AI keys are stored in
  `~/.openleaf/config.json` (mode `0600` on Unix), not the OS keychain. Moving
  to a keychain is on the roadmap.
- **Unsigned builds** - release binaries for macOS and Windows are not yet
  code-signed or notarized.

## Supported versions

OpenLeaf is pre-1.0. Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch and shipped
in the next release; only the latest release is supported.
